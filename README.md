The pomodoro technique is a proven and popular life hack for time management. This application will help you to use this technique to solve your daily tasks.

The main assumption behind the technique is to work in time blocks that are typically 25 minutes long (so-called pomodoro sessions), followed by a five-minute break. Every pomodoro session should require your full attention to a task, every break requires you to leave your work to rest. After four sessions, a long break of typically 15-30 minutes is recommended.

The result is significantly improved productivity during concentrated work sessions that can be maintained through effective management of distractions.
